# Package Template

**Note: while this should work, I have yet to test it. If you use and it doesn't work, open an issue or PR.**

This is a template for creating a new package. It is a fork of [package-template](https://github.com/fostimus/package-template) with some additional configuration for Anvil.

When creating a new repository on GitHub, you can use this template to get started. In your new repository, make sure to:

1. remove comments from the `package.json` file
2. run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. add your project's dependencies
4. profit

## TODO

- add devex for updating dependencies to see if/when we should update dependencies
